# Credit card company
Your stakeholder is a credit card company(dataset attached) that wants to market new credit cards. They have asked you to segment their potential customers to determine how and what kind of cards they should market to each group.

Use K Means to create various customer segments

Create analytical visualizations that explore statistics for each feature for each cluster.

Write a description of each cluster based on the visualizations you created. Do more than describe the numbers; try to see past the numbers and describe what kinds of people are represented by each cluster. Include at least one insight for each cluster.

Create one or two recommendations for your stakeholders (the credit card company) regarding how they should market credit cards differently or which cards they should market to each cluster based on your data and insights.
